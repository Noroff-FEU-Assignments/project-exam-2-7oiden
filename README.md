A simple overview of the use/purpose of the project.

## Description

Holidaze is an accomodation booking site for a local tourist
agancy located in Bergen. The site is coded with ReactJS based
on React Bootstrap components and styled using Sass. The site
has a customer facing side with booking functionality, and a
admin section that can be accessed with the use of JWT tokens.
In the admin section, contact and booking enquiries can be
handled as well as adding new establishments. The WP WooCommerce
API is used for the establishments and customer reviews, while a
API from Strapi hosted on Heroku is used to store and fetch data
from booking- and contact enquiries.
