      "Very good hotel near the city center. Friendly staff and very clean. Exceptional breakfast with a abundance of choice. The hotel was well-located for exploring the UNESCO World Heritage site of Bryggen and even for walking to other areas. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to those visiting Bergen.",

      "My husband and I really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The breakfast was beautiful with lots of options, staff were lovely and friendly, and the hotel and room were clean, modern and comfortable. The hotel is a short walk from various useful locations e.g. bus station, Bryggen, a shopping centre just opposite. Highly recommended!",
